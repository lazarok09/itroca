## About üïµÔ∏è
This is a e-commerce project designed to provide me the best way to create simple, fast and furious API with documentations based on Swagger at the backend, and a nice setup of Docker to up everything in seconds. Here we have auth, the CRUD basics operations and a responsive website that will allow us to sell some iphones xD

I've made this project for two basic reasons, i needed to learn more about the Next 14 since i've been a specialist for a while. And of course, almostly because of the back-end, cause i needed to learn more about cookies, swagger-api and CORS. 

So don't forget to checkout the [readme](https://github.com/lazarok09/itroca-backend) of that back-end.

### Getting Started

1. With Docker
```bash
docker build . -t itroca

docker run -p 3000:3000 itroca

```

2. Development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost](http://localhost:3000) at your browser to see the results.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
